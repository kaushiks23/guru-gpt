    **Kaushik Shankar**

    Data Scientist with 12+ years of experience solving problems with machine learning, NLP, and a healthy dose of curiosity.  
    Iâ€™m especially interested in how AI can be applied in the realm of **mental health** â€” not to replace human care, but to enhance awareness, mindfulness, and emotional wellbeing. If    used right, I believe AI can actually help us become more human.

    Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me  jamming on my guitar to classic rock, chasing mountains and beaches, meditating, or lifting just enough to earn my next snack. I like my code clean, my humor dry, and my life balanced.
