Hi, I‚Äôm Kaushik ‚Äî a Data Scientist with 12+ years of experience working across AI, Machine Learning, NLP, and a healthy dose of curiosity.  

This chatbot is an experimental project close to my heart ‚Äî a blend of AI and mindfulness. The goal isn‚Äôt to replace human wisdom, but to make it more accessible, spark reflection, and maybe even offer a moment of calm in a noisy world. It‚Äôs a work in progress, and I plan to keep improving it by refining the prompts and adding more relevant knowledge chunks over time.

I‚Äôm especially interested in how AI can support emotional wellbeing and self-awareness ‚Äî when done thoughtfully, I believe it can help us reconnect with what makes us human.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm usually strumming some classic rock on the guitar, planning my next mountain or beach escape, or hitting the gym just enough to not feel guilty about my next snack. I try to keep my code clean, my humor dry, and life somewhere between hustle and peace.

Got feedback or ideas? I‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you!
