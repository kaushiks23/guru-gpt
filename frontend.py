Hi, I‚Äôm Kaushik ‚Äî a Data Scientist with 12+ years of experience working across AI, Machine Learning, NLP, and a healthy dose of curiosity.  

This chatbot is an experimental project close to my heart ‚Äî a blend of AI and mindfulness. The goal isn‚Äôt to replace human wisdom, but to make it more accessible, spark reflection, and maybe even offer a moment of calm in a noisy world. It‚Äôs a work in progress, and I plan to keep improving it by refining the prompts and adding more relevant knowledge chunks over time.

I‚Äôm especially interested in how AI can support emotional wellbeing and self-awareness ‚Äî when done thoughtfully, I believe it can help us reconnect with what makes us human.

Outside of work, you‚Äôll probably find me jamming to classic rock, chasing mountains and beaches, or lifting just enough to justify my next snack. I like my code clean, my humor dry, and my life balanced.

Got feedback or ideas? I‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you:
